# Age-and-Gender-Detection

Age and gender, two of the key facial attributes, play a very foundational role in social interactions, making age and gender estimation from a single face image an important task in intelligent applications, such as access control, human-computer interaction, law enforcement, marketing intelligence and visual surveillance, etc.

Convolutional neural network is used in this project for detecting Age and Gender from an human face.
